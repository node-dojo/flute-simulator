G FLUTE V1 TEST SPECIFICATIONS
================================

STARTING PIPE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Length: 350mm (0.35m)
- Inner Diameter: 31mm (0.031m)
- Wall Thickness: 2mm (0.002m)
- Material: (To be specified)

TARGET SPECIFICATIONS:
- Key: G4 (G in the 4th octave)
- Fundamental Frequency: 392 Hz
- Speed of Sound: 343 m/s (at 20°C)

CALCULATED DIMENSIONS:
- Required Acoustic Length (Leff): 219mm
- End Correction (ΔL): 31mm
- Required Physical Length: 188mm
- Available Extra Length: 162mm

END CORRECTION FACTORS:
- K1 (Mouthpiece): 0.36
- K2 (Open End): 0.63
- Total End Correction: 31mm

SUGGESTED LAYOUT (350mm total):
- Slow Air Chamber: ~50mm
- Block: ~10mm  
- Main Bore: ~188mm
- Extra Length: ~102mm

TONE HOLE POSITIONS (from mouthpiece end):
- A (440 Hz): ~165mm
- B (494 Hz): ~145mm
- C (523 Hz): ~130mm
- D (587 Hz): ~115mm
- E (659 Hz): ~100mm
- F# (740 Hz): ~85mm
- G (784 Hz): ~70mm

TONE HOLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Hole Diameter: 6-8mm (recommended)
- Hole Spacing: 15-20mm between centers
- Hole Depth: 1mm (half wall thickness)

FIPPLE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Sound Hole Width: 7-8mm (25% of bore diameter)
- Sound Hole Length: 12-15mm (40-50% of bore diameter)
- Sound Hole Depth: 1mm (half wall thickness)
- Block Height: 4-5mm (above sound hole)
- Flue Depth: 5-6mm (from plug top to block bottom)
- Plug Position: Adjustable for tuning
- Air Stream Angle: 45-60 degrees (block height dependent)

CONSTRUCTION NOTES:
1. Mark the 188mm point from one end as the main bore length
2. The extra 162mm can be used for:
   - Slow air chamber
   - Block area
   - Decorative elements
   - Or cut off if not needed
3. Drill tone holes starting from the 70mm mark
4. Test each hole as you drill to verify pitch

TESTING PROCEDURE:
1. Block the end at 188mm mark
2. Test fundamental G note (392 Hz)
3. Drill holes one at a time, testing each
4. Use tuner to verify frequencies
5. Adjust hole sizes if needed for intonation

CALCULATION VERIFICATION:
- Physical Length: 188mm
- End Corrections: 31mm
- Effective Length: 219mm
- Calculated Frequency: 392 Hz ✓

DESIGN FLEXIBILITY:
- Can use full 350mm length for longer slow air chamber
- Can cut to 200mm for more compact design
- Extra length allows for experimentation with block placement
- Wall thickness (2mm) is adequate for tone hole drilling

NEXT STEPS:
1. Decide on final length (188mm or use full 350mm)
2. Mark drilling points
3. Begin construction
4. Test and adjust as needed
